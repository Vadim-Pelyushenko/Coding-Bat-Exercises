# CodingBat Exercises
Just some programming exercises from the website http://codingbat.com/java
I plan to go through all of these exercises. The exercises will both be
a way for me to practice programming, as well as an exercise in the usage of
GitHub as part of my workflow.
I have begun doing these exercises March 7th 2018.

All the exercises(317 of them) have been completed as of March 27th 2018.
